.SH NAME

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bombardment
is part of the Siege package.  It calls siege with an initial number of
clients.  When that run finishes, it immediately calls siege again with
that number of clients plus the increment.  It does this the number of
times specified in the fourth argument.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "urlfile"
The name of the file containing one or more URLs for siege to test.

.BR "initial number of clients"
The number of clients to be used on the first Siege run.

.BR "delay"
The is the amount of time, in seconds, that each client will wait between
requests.  The Siege default of 3 is overridden by

.SH NOTES
.B bombardment
can very easily overcome process and filehandle limits.  Siege DOES give a
warning if it is going to exceed 600 concurrent processes.  See your
system documentation (or try ulimit \-a) for information on the limits of
your system before using a high number of concurrent users.
