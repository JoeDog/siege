          INSTALLATION PROCEDURE & PLATFORM INFORMATION


Siege was originally built and tested on GNU/Linux. It has been ported
to other platforms. See the MACHINES document for more details. 

This program was built using the GNU autoconf mechanism.  If you are
familiar with GNU applications, then siege should present few problems 
especially on the above mentioned platforms. For best results, use gcc.

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading from an earlier version, you MUST delete
the older version before installing this one. The simplest way to remove
the older version to run "make uninstall" in the old source directory. 
If you no longer have the old source, you can configure the new version
to be installed in the same place as the old version.  Then BEFORE you
run "make install", run "make uninstall" first. 

"Hey! I'm impatient, I only read these things when things go wrong!"
If that is the case, then follow the steps in item #1 below...

   XXX: If you pulled this code from github.com then you won't have a 
   configure script. You'll need to build one. How do you do that? In 
   the top level source directory run this:
   $ utils/bootstrap

   NOTE: the bootstrap requires GNU autotools in order to run. You'll 
   need autoconf, automake and libtool installed on your computer

1. In a nutshell, to install the application in the default directory,
   ( /usr/local ), run the following commands:
   $ ./configure (IMPORTANT: see step 2 for enabling https support)
   $ make
   $ make uninstall (if you have an older version installed in PREFIX)
   $ make install

   This will install the application ( siege ) in the default directory
   /usr/local/bin.  If that directory is in your PATH, then to run siege
   and view the online help type:
   $ siege --help 
	
   To learn more about siege, make sure /usr/local/man is in your 
   MANPATH and type:
   $ man siege

   For more detailed information about running siege and stress testing
   HTTP servers, type:
   $ man layingsiege 

   For more details, read on. Especially if you want to install siege
   in a directory other that /usr/local/bin  

2. Configuration
   The configure script attempts to guess the values which are set
   on your platform.  If all goes well, you should only have to run it
   with some preferred arguments.  The more notable ones are listed 
   below:
   --help                 prints the configure script's help section
   --prefix=/some/dir     installs the files in /some/dir
   --bindir=/some/bin     installs the executable in /some/bin
   --mandir=/some/man     installs the man page in /some/man
   --with-ssl=/some/dir   where dir is where you installed ssl, this
                          flag is used to enable https protocol.


   Since siege is a pretty esoteric program, I prefer to install it in 
   my home directory.  For this reason, I run configure with my home 
   directory as the prefix.
   
   $ ./configure --prefix=/export/home/jdfulmer

   If you don't already, make sure $HOME/bin and $HOME/man are set 
   appropriately in your .profile.  In my case, I set them like this:

   # jdfulmer's profile
   PATH=/export/home/jdfulmer/bin:$PATH
   MANPATH=/export/home/jdfulmer/man:$MANPATH

   export PATH MANPATH
   ~
   ~
   
   To reload your profile without logging out, do this:
   
   $ . .profile

   If it runs successfully, the configure script creates the Makefiles 
   which lets you build the program.  After you configure your 
   environment, the next step is to build siege. If that step fails, you
   may have to return to this step.  Reasons for reconfiguring are 
   mentioned below.  If configure failed to create Makefiles, then you 
   have problems which may be beyond the scope of this document, such as
   no compiler ( you'll have to get one ), no libraries (again, an 
   acquisition on your part).

   HTTPS support
   To enable https, you must have ssl installed on your system.  Get the 
   latest version from http://www.openssl.org. AFTER ssl is installed, 
   then you have to configure siege to use it:
   $ ./configure --prefix=/some/dir --with-ssl=/ssl/install/dir

   The openssl default installation is /usr/local/ssl. If you installed
   openssl in that directory, then you would configure siege like this:
   $ ./configure --prefix=/some/dir --with-ssl=/usr/local/ssl
   $ make
   $ make uninstall (if you have a previous version already installed)
   $ make install

3. Compilation
   To compile the program, execute the second step of the nutshell 
   version mentioned in item #1: type "make" and hope for the best. 
   If your environment was configured without errors, then configure 
   should have generated the Makefiles that will enable this step to 
   work.

   The make command will invoke your compiler and build siege.  If you
   are using gcc on any of the platforms mentioned above, then you 
   should not have problems.  In general, any ANSI C compiler should 
   work. 

   Some systems may require options that were not set by the configure 
   script. You can set them using the configure step mentioned above:
   $ CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure 

   You can also set them by editing the Makefiles that were created as
   a result of running configure, but this is not preferred. 

4. Installation
   If the program compiled successfully, follow the third nutshell step
   and type "make install"  This will install the package in the 
   directories that you've selected in the configuration step.  If they 
   are not already, make sure PREFIX/bin and PREFIX/man are in your PATH
   and MANPATH respectively. This process is described in detail above. 

   Files installed:
   siege          -->    SIEGE_HOME/bin/siege
   bombardment    -->    SIEGE_HOME/bin/bombardment
   siege2csv      -->    SIEGE_HOME/bin/siege2csv
   siege.config   -->    $HOME/.siege/siege.config
   cookies.txt    -->    $HOME/.siege/cookies.txt
   siege.1        -->    SIEGE_HOME/man/man1/siege.1
   bombardment.1  -->    SIEGE_HOME/man/man1/bombardment.1
   siege2csv.1    -->    SIEGE_HOME/man/man1/siege2csv.1

5. Uninstall
   To remove the package, type "make uninstall"  To make the source 
   directory completely clean, type "make distclean".  There are 
   differences of opinion regarding this option.  Some people claim that
   it should not be available as it depends the original Makefiles from 
   the source directory. Since I tend to hoard all source code, I like 
   this feature.

   The point is, if you've installed one version of siege in /usr/local
   and another version in $HOME, then make uninstall is obviously not 
   going to work in both locations.  The safest thing to do is manually 
   remove the files which were installed by make install. The files and 
   their locations are described in item #4.

6. Read the documentation
   The online help is pretty straight forward ( siege --help ):

    -A, --user-agent="text"   Sets User-Agent in request
    -T, --content-type="text" Sets Content-Type in request

   For more detailed information, consult the man pages:
   $ man siege
   $ man siege.config

   All the siege man pages are also available online:
   http://www.joedog.org/siege/

   OR, read the manual online:
   http://www.joedog.org/siege/manual.html 

7. Edit the .siege/siege.config file in your home directory.  This file
   contains runtime directives for siege.  Each directive is well
   documented with comments.  Some directives exist ONLY in this file;
   they don't have a command line option.  If you are upgrading from an
   earlier version, your original version is kept and a new resource 
   file is installed as .siegerc.new.  In order to take advantage of any
   new directives, you might want to use this new file instead.
